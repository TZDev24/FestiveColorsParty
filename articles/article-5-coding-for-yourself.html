<main class="article-main-content">
  <p>You know, a lot of people are like "You should learn to code so you can have a good career and make good money." I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with having (or wanting to have) a good, well-paying career per-se, but there's more to coding (and tech in general, for that matter) than just getting a job as a developer.</p>

  <h2 class="article-bold">Doing things for yourself, not employers</h2>
  <p>Maybe having a cushy tech job is nice, I wouldn't know since, as of this point in my life, I've never worked in tech. What I'm saying is, you don't just have to code with money being the sole end-goal of it. Have fun with it. Use it to make your own games, your own tools, things that benefit yourself and maybe others, too.</p>

  <p>For example, the website you're reading this on (Unless you saved this article or website as local files on your computer, but that's beside the point). I didn't create this website with the expectation, or even the intention, of making money. I created it because I thought it would be cool and potentially useful for myself and hopefully others. You know, because I wanted a place on the internet to write my thoughts and opinions, and even make my own tools and services.</p>

  <p>Running this website comes with some benefits, but at the time of writing this, it's more of a hobby than a job.</p>
