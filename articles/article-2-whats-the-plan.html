  <p>So here I'm gonna talk about my plan, or lack thereof, haha. Truth is... <strong>I don't really have a plan.</strong> I don't really know yet what I'm gonna do with this site. However, I can talk about some things that I'd like to be the case with my website.</p>

  <h2 class="article-bold">Performance</h2>
  <p>The site needs to be fast. I want it to load fast, even on slow machines and internet connections. I'd like to avoid creating pages that load slow and eat up your RAM for no apparent reason.</p>

  <h2 class="article-bold">Simple, not too distracting</h2>
  <p>I'd like to avoid social engineering and <i>intentionally</i> addicting people to my website. That's evil.</p>

  <h2 class="article-bold">Useful(?)</h2>
  <p>This one is kinda funny because at the time of writing this, there's barely anything here. Hopefully I can provide something useful to someone in time.</p>
