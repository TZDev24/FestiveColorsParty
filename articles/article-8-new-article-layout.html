  <h3 class="article-section">A newer layout</h3>

  <p>In an attempt to improve and make future articles (or BlogPosts, if you want to call them that) nicer and more readable, I have made some changes to the styling rules for these articles. Hopefully this makes things a little nicer for anyone reading this site. I'll try to find something to write about here.</p>

  <h3 class="article-section">Refinement</h3>

  <p>Creating this site has mostly been a pleasure. I'll admit that it could use a bit of refinement. Longer, more detailed articles, for instance. Most of the articles I've written up to this point have no real substance or otherwise useful information on them. Most of them have been just me making statements on moral values and stuff, virtue signaling that doesn't really contribute anything. In the future I'd like to have more articles that serve as tutorials and guides, containing useful, meaningful information.</p>

  <p>I'm aware that I'm writing a bit of a word salad here. I guess this post is more of a status check than anything; testing the new layout and thinking out loud a little bit about where things go from here.</p>
