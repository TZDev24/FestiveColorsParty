  <h2 class="article-bold">(Semi)-Automated blogpost creation</h2>
  <p>So I made a small Python script that allows me to generate the boilerplate HTML code needed for these articles. All I have to do is enter the article title and it will create the article and automatically put the date underneath it. It's convenient.</p>

  <p>It also means I get to save some time and be a bit more lazy. That's always nice.</p>

  <h2 class="article-bold">DIY</h2>
  <p>Since I'm not using anything like wordpress or other things for blogging (besides just having a VPS and hosting a website with nginx), it's sort of on me to make my own tools to automate the process and just generally make it easier for myself.</p>
