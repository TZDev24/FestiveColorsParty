  <h2 class="article-bold">Intro Test</h2>
  <p>I am writing this article in an attempt to design one that <strong>Looks</strong> good and isn't <i>too</i> difficult to read. This one's just a test to see what I can do. Ideally articles/blogposts should not be <i>too</i> long, and there shouldn't be anything taking too much attention away from the main content, right?</p>

  <h2 class="article-bold">Simplicity and performance</h2>
  <p>If I'm gonna write articles / blogposts on my site, one thing I'd like to do is make sure the page doesn't take too long to load. Maybe for some the performance isn't that important, but to me it's important that these pages load fast on older/slower computers and slower internet connections. It's also good to optimize these pages for visitors who have data limits.</p>
